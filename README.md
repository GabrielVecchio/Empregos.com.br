This is only a simple HTML written by me for Empregos.com.br while I worked there.

For their target, they needed to send the same e-mail to three different bases with different content, which means the structure as well as the layout is the same, hence the archive is called 'exAssinantes.html' 

Hope everything is fine and dandy and you may find no mistakes at all

it is responsive and I used mediaquery to perform its fluid design.
